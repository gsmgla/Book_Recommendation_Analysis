# Book_Recommendation_Analysis

# Project Overview

An open-source dataset of book recommendations using Jupyter Notebooks to clean, merge, analyze and provide a recommender system to effectively compete and maintain relevance in today's dynamic book market for traditional book publishing houses.

## Context

I selected this dataset based on its alignment with the outlined project brief requirements from CareerFoundry, and it holds the potential for creating a compelling and insightful project within the book industry.

## Objectives

Implement a feedback loop within the recommender system, enabling users to rate and provide feedback on suggested books: The goal is to utilize this valuable user data for a continual enhancement of recommendations, ensuring adaptability to the changing tastes and preferences of readers over time.

## Data

The owner of the [dataset]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset) is MÃ¶bius on Kaggle.
The data was compiled by Cai-Nicolas Ziegler in a 4-week crawl (August/September 2004) from the Book-Crossing community with kind permission from Ron Hornbaker, CTO of Humankind Systems.

## Data Limitations

The data is static and won't undergo updates. Due to the absence of integrated revenue data, making financial predictions is not feasible.

## Data Ethics

The dataset contains 278,858 users (anonymized but with demographic information) providing 1,149,780 ratings (explicit/implicit) about 271,379 books, thus respecting privacy and being open source.

## Tools

_Language_: Python

_Libraries_: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, sklearn, train_test_split, LinearRegression, mean_squared_error, r2_score, KMeans, seaborn, folium, json

_Software_: Jupyter Notebooks, Tableau, Canva
